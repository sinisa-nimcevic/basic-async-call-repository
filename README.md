# React testing library example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A very basic use case of `redux` implemented using `redux-toolkit`, namely `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`. Read more in the official [documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

The app serves as a dummy implementation of some basic functionality in order to explain best practices with regards to app architecture and testing.
